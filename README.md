**🐍 Snake Game (Python)**
===
A classic Snake game built with Python Turtle graphics, where the player controls the snake, eats food to grow longer, and avoids collisions with walls and its own tail.

**📌 Project Description**

This Snake Game recreates the traditional arcade-style gameplay using Python’s Turtle module.
The snake moves continuously, grows when it eats food, and the score increases with each successful bite. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

This project focuses on object-oriented programming, animation, collision detection, and game loops.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

* Python 3
* Turtle Graphics
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Time module

**📂 Project Structure**

    main.py         # Main game loop and controls
    snake.py        # Snake movement and behavior
    food.py         # Food generation
    scoreboard.py  # Score display and game over logic

**▶️ How It Works**

1. The game window opens with a black background
2. The snake starts moving automatically
3. Player controls:
* ⬆️ Up Arrow → Move Up
* ⬇️ Down Arrow → Move Down
* ⬅️ Left Arrow → Move Left
* ➡️ Right Arrow → Move Right
4. When the snake eats food:
* The snake grows longer
* Score increases
5. The game ends if:
* The snake hits the wall
* The snake collides with its own body

**🎮 Gameplay Example**

    Score: 5
    
    GAME OVER

**🎯 What I Learned**

* Implementing OOP using multiple classes
* Creating smooth animations with Turtle
* Handling keyboard input
* Detecting collisions
* Managing game state and score
* Structuring a medium-sized Python project

**🚀 Future Improvements**

* Add high-score saving
* Add restart/play-again option
* Increase difficulty over time
* Add sound effects
* Improve visuals and animations

**🙌 Acknowledgment**

This project is part of my Python learning journey and helped me understand how classic games can be built using clean, object-oriented design in Python.
